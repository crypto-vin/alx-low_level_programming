# Low Level Programming & Algorithms 

## Introduction

C is a low-level programming language which implies that it provides little or no abstraction from a computer's instruction set architectureâ€”commands or functions in the language map closely to processor instructions. This refers to either machine code or assembly language. The word "low" references the small or nonexistent amount of abstraction between the language and machine language; because of this, low-level languages are sometimes described as being "close to the hardware". Programs written in low-level languages tend to be relatively non-portable, and a very good example of such is the C programming language, which forms the basis of these projects.

# About

ALX Africa Software Engineering Programme offers several tracks and tips on becoming a full stack software engineer. One of the basics is the low level programming track which ingrains the skill into the learner by covering the following areas.

- Compilation
- Commenting code and articulating coding blocks based on the betty coding style
- Variables, types, operators, expressions, loops, nested loops
- Conditional statements
- Functions
- Pre-processor, macros, header files, pointers, double pointers, function pointers, pointer arithmetic
- Makefiles
- Sorting and search algorithms, among others.

# Requirements

- Ubuntu 20.04
- gcc 9.4.0 (-Wall, -Werror, -Wextra, and -pedantic flags)
