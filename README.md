# Low Level Programming & Algorithms 

## Introduction

C is a low-level programming language which implies that it provides little or no abstraction from a computer's instruction set architectureâ€”commands or functions in the language map closely to processor instructions. This refers to either machine code or assembly language. The word "low" references the small or nonexistent amount of abstraction between the language and machine language; because of this, low-level languages are sometimes described as being "close to the hardware". Programs written in low-level languages tend to be relatively non-portable, and a very good example of such is the C programming language, which forms the basis of these projects.
